# Micro Manage : Working with Dates and Times

## Summary
This program is an assignment completed during my time at Dev Bootcamp computer programming school. The focus of this assignment is to use date time format to organize and sort task. A challenge encountered while completing this assignment was ensuring the date input matched the same format across all task instances and also developing a method that could read the date format. The solution to this challenge was to use a .strf string to format user inputs on the client side and to use that same .strf string format in my sorting method.
